<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](/public/screenshot.png)

This app is built using the Svelte framework and is hosted on Netlify. You can view the demo on https://country-quiz-devchallenge.netlify.app. I had a really fun experience building this app, especially with a 2 hour time limit that I gave my self. And this is the first time I am using Svelte for a project, so learning Svelte from scratch was a part of the process. Overall, building simple apps like these can really help in learning a framework.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

On loading the app for the first time, the results from [RestCountries](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) is cached on localStorage. On subsequent loads, the data is then taken from the cache instead of making a request to RestCountries everytime.

## How To Use

To view the source of this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/your-project-name

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
